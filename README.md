# Pass-By-Value-And-Reference

Arguments can generally be passed to function in one of the following two ways

- Pass by value(call by value)
- Pass by reference(call by reference)

### Pass by Value

In this method, the value of each of the actual arguments in the calling function is copied into corresponding formal arguments of the function. With this method the changes made to the formal arguments in the called function have no effect on the value of actual arguments in the calling function.
